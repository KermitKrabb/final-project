                <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Hi, again. As you read earlier, my name is Christopher Coutinho. I graduate high school in 2016 at El Cerrito High School and recieved a completion certificate for the school's Information Technology Academy (ITA) where we were introduced to many aspects of the technology world, including Digital Art, HTML/ CSS, coding in Ruby and applying it to robotics, and the basic hardware of computers themselves. I also used to play trombone in the school's Concert & Symphonic band and used to play ultimate frisbee for my high school's team back then. I am currently attending Contra Costa College and majoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in the field of technology in general and it's what pulled me into this type of major.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 20px;">There's many things i like to do in my free time. I enjoy physical activities like going to the gym and skateboarding/ longboarding, I had even begun taking up indoor rock-climbing recently. I also enjoy cooking when I have the time to fully prepare a meal and playing many types of games, video, board, or card games. Mostly I enjoy trying new things. I love discovering something new to me and becoming invested into it until I feel I understand it or taken all i feel I could learn from it.</p>

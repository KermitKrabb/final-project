               <li>I used to work a graveyard shift at an Amazon Warehouse from October 2018 - February 2019, where I performed many different tasks such as unloading delivery trailers full of packages onto conveyor belts, scanning packages to be sorted to different areas of the warehouse, receiving packages, and stowing them into their appropriate delivery containers to be shipped out in the morning.

            <div class="maintext"><li>Currently I work at MOD Pizza as a shift lead but started as an entry level squad member. As a squad memeber I help maintain cleanliness of the store, press out dough to standard, help customers assemble their food, manage cash during transactions, cook multiple different orders at the same time (some with specifications to them), prepare and hand off completed orders to customers, and maintain positive interactions with said customers.
            </li>
            div.maintext
            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Once I got promoted to shift lead my responsibilities included directing the team in the store so that every station is being properly attended to, training of any new hires, dealing with any issues, refunds, or concerns customers had personally, making sure my team's breaks were being given out at reasonable times, managing time to ensure everything was being done as efficiently as possible, counting and depositing the store's profits at the end of the day, and helping my manager with any day-to-day task needed for the store. This would sometimes include commuting to other MOD stores to pick up any supplies or ingredients we might have run out of through the week or taking inventory of the store.</p></div>
